# LunarLander
  The Lunar lander is an Asynchronous Simulation of a Lunar Aircraft landing on the moon. You are given three tries to land the Aircraft
  safely on the moon. If you crash and burn more than three times the game is over.

  You are given the choice to use three different landers, and with these different landers you can either thrust, free fall, or repeat 
your last move. If you thrust, you can only thrust for a max of 3 seconds and you use one fuel pellet, but if you free fall, 
you are given the freedom to free fall for however long you want. Be careful not to free fall directly into the moon, you will crash the
lander and kill your astronauts.

You start with a total of 270 fuel pellets in 6 different fuel cells. These fuel pellets are then taken out of each fuel cell 
in a catty corner manner for even weight distribution of the aircraft. The craft position starts 500 meters above the move and you also 
start with a random negative velocity. This is because you are falling towards the moon. 

Have fun and good luck, DON'T KILL TOO MANY ASTRONAUTS IT'S INHUMAN!
